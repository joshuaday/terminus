Terminus
========

Terminus is a peculiar little experiment and it's very much
a work in progress; it is waiting, for instance, on the
development of the terminal module that has since been
adapted for use in Cronus (and which it, in turn, had
inherited from Tactical Command).

In Terminus, the simulation is smooth and runs in real time,
like any other platform game, but the display is pure ascii
designed to be displayed by tty.  The input scheme is
designed for tty, too; rather than holding directional keys,
the player is meant to *tap* them repeatedly.

Use the vi keys (hjklyubn) to move around, but there's nothing
much to do just yet.  Shift-Q to quit.
